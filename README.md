# repeat-purchase-prediction
This project predicts whether a customer will repurchase a product using XGBoost and SMOTE for handling class imbalance. Built in Google Colab, it simulates a real-world business case relevant to retail and FMCG industries. The dataset includes customer behavior features such as order frequency, recency, and product category.

Key focus: classification, class imbalance handling, and model evaluation.
